                                            "Shiv Jayanti" is a widely celebrated festival all over Maharashtra. Shiv Jayanti is the birthday of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the adored deity of Maharashtra. While thinking of Swadhey, we were thinking of doing something special on the day of Shiv Jayanti, but what exactly? Shiv Jayanti is celebrated with great enthusiasm all over Maharashtra. In many places, musical bands and rallies are held and many people celebrate Shiv Jayanti in their own way.<br><br>
                                            &nbsp;We believe in Maharaj and follow his thoughts. One of his thoughts was that he preferred his Maratha soldiers (मावळे) and the people of Swarajya before himself. Respecting his thoughts, On 19th February 2020, on the occasion of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti, we provide some snacks and water to the Mavales of present-day Maharashtra, i.e. The police. we carried out this project on the Durgadi fort, which has a historical heritage. We distributed snacks and water to more than 100 policemen. The same was also distributed to the poor and this is how we celebrated Shiv Jayanti. From now on, we will celebrate this day with a similar event every year. We expect your warm support and blessings in our efforts.

                                            From around December, 2019 corona virus started spreading from China to other countries. India started suffering by corona from near by March, 2020 and Prime Minister Shree. Narendra Modi addressed the nation on Thursday evening, calling for "resolve and restraint" to fight the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.<br><br>
                                            In the nearly 30-minute long broadcast, PM Narendra Modi asked people to stay at home as much as possible and break the chain of the virus. Mumbai, the economic capital of India got the most number of corona virus patients in India.<br><br>
                                            The Government of India is constantly keeping a close watch on this situation, and this track record of the spread of the virus. But because of this corona virus and lockdown poor people and people who work on hand suffered a lot.<br><br>
                                            Basically, this was the first time India was facing such situations and crisis so the government was not able to take instant actions. It was wisdom to stay at home, these days but what about people who do not have home to stay home?<br><br>
                                            When people were not getting food to stay alive who will become a saviour of them? This was the big question in front of all of us!<br><br>
                                            Then we got to know about a person Mr. Prashant Kadam one of our friend started working as a saviour for needies, we totally got inspired by him as he too was suffering from the same situation still trying to help others and that was the time we thought of doing something. Swadhey was an idea where we started doing things as much as we can that can help people. We started spreading awareness among people through Swadhey where people started helping us by donating and we started food distribution to the needy ones. We thought of continuing this till the lockdown ends but this lockdown was extended 4 times. After first lockdown government too started helping the needy, but as this lockdown extended we continued with the same to help needy. That is a great experience to help someone. Someone cannot help everyone, but everyone can help someone was a bang on our heads.<br><br>
                                            We kept it going and a help from people like you and us we trying to overcome this nightmare - COVID - 19

                                            Severe Cyclonic Storm Nisarga was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike the Indian state of Maharashtra in the month of June, 2020 since 1891.<br><br>
                                            Nisarga caused 6 deaths and 16 injuries in the state. Over 5,033 hectares (12,440 acres) of land was damaged. The Government of Maharashtra announced immediate aid to the relatives of the deaths. The Nisarga cyclone hit very hard on the Indian west coast. Especially Mumbai, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts in Maharashtra. We wanted to help all these cyclone affected areas. But at the same time, we knew we can't help everyone.  At that time we could help only in Ratnagiri district and we did help them by providing some financial support.<br><br>
                                            It helps people to rebuild their homes and places which indirectly help them to fight the situation. We are very thankful to Mr. Nilesh Tandel for handing over the financial help from Swadhey Foundation to the affected ones.

                                            Raksha Bandhan is an important Hindu cultural originated festival widely celebrated in India. It is celebrated by tieing a rakhi to the protector for thanking him / her. Some gifts or a token of care love affection is given in return.<br><br>
                                            The thought of RAKHI FOR RAKSHAK is also the same. Our Rakshak are those who are standing on border and fighting for our peace without even having second thought about their safety.<br><br>
                                            Yes , we are talking about our soldiers. They are protecting us without expecting anything in return. This is where Swadhey steps in. We decided to celebrate this festival with them as well.<br><br>
                                            But how ? One of our volunteers has reached out us and gave idea about this project. The moto behind this initiative is to make everyone aware about our real brothers who are protecting us in a real meaning. And to tell them that even if we are not there physically to tie a rakhi on your wrist we still stand beside you.<br><br>
                                            We have sent 50 rakhi's along with some messages we received from people. It's a thanks giving tribute to our soldier brothers on behalf of many Indians.<br>

                                            A number of initiatives are being implemented under the Swadhey Foundation. At the same time, planning is in motion on many important issues. One of them was, the desire to do something for the children of poor families or for those who could not learn despite their love for education and this initiative can be marked as a beginning.<br><br>
                                            This project is about Priya Shinde and her adolescent daughters. This family is located in Ulhasnagar-a Mumbai suburb. The family consists of parents and 4 young daughters who are having numerous problems. An Addicted father, Financial Crisis and a daily fight to bring at least a single meal of the day to a plate. When we found them they were in devastating situation. The place was completely flooded with tons of dirt, mosquitoes, was stinking.<br><br>
                                            According to our vision, we don't just help people who need help. But also help people who want to help themselves. With that in mind, SWADHEY team had a talk with the lady (Mother). Then it was decided that in the next 2 days, the family would be moved to another better place and will be provided with basic help and education to the little girls. The situation of this family was revealed to us by one of our friend, Bhavesh. We really want to thank him for his wonderful selfless deed. With such support and help of the people like Bhavesh, there is no doubt that such great deeds will be done in the future as well. Special thanks to Yari Foundation.

                                            Diwali, the most widely celebrated festival in India and in recent times outside India as well. It's basically a festival of lights, celebrated by decorating house with lamps.<br><br>
                                            The reason of celebration is known to all, although the way of celebration is up to everyone.<br><br>
                                            We all were thrilled as this was the first occasion to celebrate the Diwali festival by SWADHEY FOUNDATION we wanted to do it in an innovative way as well contributing a bit towards society too. They say that, we attract what we think, and within a few days, the Idea of DIWALI AT FORT  hit in our mind...
                                                    We had begun to wonder what a magnificent and beautiful scenario must have been witnessed by the people during the era of <span class="boldText">Maratha Empire</span>. So, why not now, we too can give it a try to decorate it again. And thus the idea of ​​DURG DIPOTSAV came about.<br><br>
                                                    And then, TEAM SWADHEY did a successful campaign.
                                                    During Durg Dipotsav, fort cleaning campaign, fort decoration, lighting of lamps was done by Swadhey. On this occasion, Swadhey Foundation itself took the first step in  CONSERVATION OF  FORT and the thought was brought to reality.<br><br>
                                                    A wholehearted thank you to everyone who participated in this campaign and supported us.

                                            The main purpose behind this collaboration between SWADHEY FOUNDATION and TECH FOR EDUCATION is to work on common or similar project for social benefit.<br><br>
                                            There has been a spike in the number of students who have stopped studying! TECH FOR EDUCATION is a community which helps underprivileged school students who have lost touch with education after March 2020 due to COVID. They help them connect online by placing donated android devices in their hands and teaching them how to use it the right way! Their lack of online communication with the teachers and the institution can cause a massive loss in the coming future as it will be difficult for them to get back to their studies.<br><br>
                                            SWADHEY FOUNDATION is a foundation that works towards the betterment of society, one individual at a time! We are also on our way to nourish the roots, the children, our future in every way possible! We fulfil all these kid's necessities selflessly and work day in and day out to make sure that nothing is left out on their part. Recently, we expanded our domain to include education as a part of their offering to these kids. Soon, sessions will be conducted online and kids will be trained on various topics ranging from English and Reading to Nutrition and Health. It is as special as these kids are. It is our privilege to work along with TECH FOR EDUCATION and make a difference in society.

                                            Today we visited the Gurukul Girls hostel under Jeevan Samvardhan Foundation, Waghbil, Thane. This is one of the girl's hostel where our online education sessions are carried out by GYC's team. We would like to thank all the GYC Team members for being there and supporting all girls for their future development. Also, we have donated some clothes which we received from one family. We are really happy to see such kind people who contribute to society. We have also donated 3 smartphones to the hostel for online education. Now it will be a bit easier for them to connect online and be a part of the session.

                                            This project is about Bhaskar Suryavanshi and his three sons. This family is located in Ambernath-a Mumbai suburb. An Addicted father, Financial Crisis and a daily fight to bring at least a single meal of the day to a plate. When we found them they were in devastating situation.<br><br>
                                            According to our vision, we don't just help people who need help. But also help people who want to help themselves. With that in mind, SWADHEY team had a talk with the Father. Then, it was decided that the family would be supported with basic help and education to the boys. So, the boys were shifted to Jeevan Samvardhan Foundation, Mhaskal.<br><br>
                                            The situation of this family was revealed to us by one of our team member Mrs. Asha Shende. We really appreciate her concern.

                                            People celebrate their birthdays and anniversaries by celebrating in many fancy ways. We have celebrated our 1st anniversary in a unique way. We visited an old age home "Janiv Vrudhashram" situated at Kharad Village, Malang gad road. We have done श्रमदान on our 1st anniversary. Our team spent quality time in an old age home. It was really good and very emotional experience. We had a thought that there should not be any old age home in the world and Swadhey Foundation will definitely work on it.

                                            "Shiv Jayanti" is a widely celebrated festival all over Maharashtra. Shiv Jayanti is the  birthday of <span class="boldText">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,</span> the adored deity of Maharashtra. While thinking of Swadhey, we were thinking of doing something special on the day of Shiv Jayanti, but what exactly? Shiv Jayanti is celebrated with great enthusiasm all over Maharashtra. In many places, musical bands and rallies are held and many people celebrate Shiv Jayanti in their own way.<br><br>
                                            We believe in Maharaj and follow his thoughts. One of his thoughts was that he preferred his Maratha soldiers (मावळे) and people of Swarajya before himself. Respecting his thoughts, On 19th February	 2021, on the occasion of <span class="boldText">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti,</span> we provide some snacks and water to the Mavales of present-day Maharashtra, i.e. The police. We carried out this project on the <span class="boldText">Durgadi fort,</span> which has a historical heritage. We distributed snacks and water to more than 200 policemen in Kalyan and Dombivali. The same was also distributed to the poor and this is how we celebrated Shiv Jayanti.

                                            As everyone knows Covid 19 was the biggest pandemic in the last decades. Millions of people are infected and dead in the world. So India, being the 2nd largest populated country in the world suffers the most. Life became difficult. For few it was the end, for few it was the new beginning. But all we did was fight this pandemic. <br><br>
                                            In such cases, being human we wanted to help people. In the first wave, we distributed food for 50 days continuously as 100% lockdown was imposed. But in the 2nd wave, most people could not find the proper guidance for covid. We decided to start a local Covid-19 helpline, which has a motive to help the people who were unable to find beds, medicines, hospitals, doctors, nurses, blood, and plasma donation. We created a chain of some volunteers who were directly connected to governmental or private hospitals. <br><br>
                                            We started this with our thought to help people in every case which was our successful initiative.

We all do some good things without any intentions and without even thinking about anything in return! After noticing a rapid loss of our birds from nature we initiated this activity. We decided to start creating awareness among the people on this cause. Many people supported and did this regularly.<br><br>
                                            It  was our another step of creating awareness among the people for helping animals and birds. Many people ignore the injured birds or animals like they don't even care. But by doing this activity many people showed a positive interest.

                                            When you lose a parent, you realize how vital they are to the foundation of your life. It's impossible to understand what it means until that curtain is pulled. You're an orphan, but then we think that life is kind of remarkable, and the thing that causes the biggest pain can also bring amazing energy. We visited a girl's hostel and spent quality time and spread positive vibes with them.<br><br>
                                            By God's fortune, we were blessed with every basic thing which we needed at an early stage of life. But unfortunately, these girls at the hostel were not, and our moto was to be with them whenever we can and provide the required things whenever we can.

                                            A series of floods took place across the Indian State of Maharashtra in 2021. As of 28 July 2021, around 251 people have died and over 100 are still missing due to floods and landslides. Thirteen districts have been affected in western Maharashtra.<br><br>
                                            There was a very difficult situation in most of Konkan area specifically in Mahad and Chiplun side. Looking at the scenario we decided to help the needy people. And our Help Towards Konkan Flood started. Many people donated us and we managed to distribute those materials in the Chiplun area with the help of <span class="boldText">Team Basriwala</span> and <span class="boldText">Ashwamedh Sports Foundation.</span>

                                            As you all know we send #rakhi_for_rakshak every year. This year as well we have sent rakhi's along with your wishes and messages. We would like to Thank all the Soldiers on behalf of all Indians. We really appreciate the sacrifice you make for Our Motherland. The idea behind #rakhi_for_rakshak is to show our gratitude and tribute towards Your, Our Soldiers- Our Rakshak!<br><br>
                                            The moto behind this initiative is to make everyone aware about our real brothers who are protecting us in a real meaning. And to tell them that even if we are not there physically to tie a rakhi on your wrist we still stand beside you. We have sent 200 rakhis along with some messages we received from people. It's a thanks giving tribute to our soldier brothers on behalf of many Indians.

                                            As we celebrate Raksha Bandhan by sending rakhi's to our soliders under our Rakhi for Rakshak segment, we wanted to celebrate this day personally too.<br><br>
                                            So we decided to celebrate this day at the Girls hostel (Jeevan Samvardhan Foundation, Thane). Spending quality time where it is required the most is not a waste of time. We celebrated Raksha Bandhan at Jeevan Samvardhan Foundation, Thane (Girls hostel) by making rakhis and other crafts. We spent time and took a few activities with them.

                                            "Diwali Ank" is another concept like the "Durg Dipostav". Swadhey Foundation always follows the uniqueness in every work they took in hand. Diwali Ank is the concept of a normal booklet which is given in schools or available in any book stores. These are basically named as Diwali Ank because it was meant to solve in Diwali vacation. It includes education related activities like drawing, general knowledge, information, and reading. It helps the children to be more competent and use their brains in solving such booklets.<br><br>
                                            In Swadhey Foundation's Diwali ank, we named it as "गरुडझेप", which means take a jump like Eagle and fly above all. As you know, An Eagle is a bird that flies really high in the sky and no one can fly above the eagle's height. So we had to name it like children who are solving the Diwali Ank of Swadhey Foundation, must try to take a jump (Try his best) to fly on Eagle's level or beyond that (To achieve the target which was set by you). In overall meaning, we wanted the children to get inspired by our Diwali Ank.<br><br>
                                            The whole design, content and preparation were done by, the specially qualified teachers in schools. We make Diwali Ank for 1st to 10th standard students. This year we distributed it to our Jeevan Samvardhan Foundation and many people took it from us for their children.

                                            As You know, till date we have done all the things uniquely or you can say in a different way. Diwali is one of the biggest festivals in India, and everyone celebrates in their own way.<br><br>
                                            Last year, we had an idea about the "Durg Dipotsav", which we implemented pretty well. During Durg Dipotsav, fort cleaning campaign, fort decoration, and lighting of lamps was done by Swadhey. This year we went to Sarasgad located in Pali. The fort itself has historical importance and we tried to bring a little happiness among the volunteers and implemented our conservation thoughts.<br><br>
                                            A wholehearted thank you to everyone who participated in this campaign and supported us.

                                            Swadhey Foundation has an objective of Helping Hand under which we conduct various camps and campaigns which help the needy. Under the helping hand, one of the important aspects is Health. As we have mentioned in our mission statement, 'we work on the basic needs of Human Beings'. With the same motive, Toptime India Consumer Pvt Ltd Company organizes various health camps for the people. We got to know about these camps from one of our volunteers and we reached out to them. When we met them they also wanted to conduct camps with the help of Swadhey foundation, and then we needed to set a date for camp and decided that let’s start the year with Ayurvedic Health Camp.<br><br>
                                            On the occasion of the New Year, we have organized Ayurvedic Health Camp for all the people on 1st and 2nd of January, 2022 in Kalyan East. 80+ people have been checked up and consulted by Dr. Dharmendra Dixit (MD in Naturopathy) and Miss. Vidya Ahire. This was our first ever health camp under the objective of Helping Hands. Soon we are organizing more health camps for the needy ones.

                                            Every year we celebrate Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti by distributing snacks and water to the Police. This year too we conducted this activity. This year We carried out this Activity in 5 different cities i.e. Kalyan, Dombivali, Ambernath, Badlapur and Mira road. We distributed snacks and water to more than 400 policemen. More than 30 volunteers participated in this activity. Everyone celebrates in their own way but helping others is our motive, and following the thoughts of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj we always make sure that on such special occasions we carry out such activities and create awareness among the people to help others.

                                            Arnala Beach cleaning is one of the important project under our Conserve to Preserve objective. Under Conserve to Preserve, we focus on conserving our natural resources. When we speak about conserving nature, we are really talking about taking care of our future, because nature provides essential resources for our survival and enjoyment. We often forget how much humans depend on nature.  We all love our mother, we all care for our children, we all care for our family, friends. Everyone is doing their job to earn money so that they can feed their beloved and live a healthy and happy life. But that should not be all. OUR MOTHER NATURE also needs care. People throw garbage and make nature very dirty and it causes the death of nature. This is the basic motive to conduct such activities and create awareness among people for conserving nature. On the basis of that, our team has conducted a beach cleaning activity at Arnala Beach, Virar. This was our first step towards conserving nature. We did start for the betterment of our environment and we hope this should be in everyone's mind.  COME AND JOIN US TO CLEAN OUR BEACHES & PROTECT OUR MOTHER NATURE.<br><br>

                                            Under Conserve to preserve, this was our second beach cleaning activity at Arnala Beach, Virar.  When we speak about conserving beaches, we are really talking about taking care of all the waste material at Beach along with the local awareness for cleaning.<br><br>
                                            In this second beach cleaning activity, we actually focus on cleaning the beach with the team and creating awareness among the local snacks corner, shops, and hotels. We politely informed them about the cleaning of the beach and asked them to spread this information to all of your customers and this helps us to reduce the garbage on the beach.

We have so many forts, temples and monuments which are in very bad condition. Few of them are not even known to many people.<br><br>
                                            Under our "वारसा" project, we started with the cleaning of forts, temples and monuments. As the project name itself says, we are working for our "वारसा" which means "Heritage". We conduct such activities which help to create awareness, conservation of such monuments. <br><br>
                                            On 22nd May 2022, we conducted our first fort cleaning activity at the very famous Dronagiri Fort, Uran. We focused on the temple area on the top of the fort, where we cleaned the whole place and found more than 150 bottles of alcohol. We cleaned the whole part and made it like a temple properly. <br>

                                            Under our Unplugged Education project, we carry out many visits / activities to the hostels where we can interact with the children and help them wherever they need the help in studies or extra-curricular work. Unplugged Education is a very broad concept but we started with the basic steps. Under this, we try to take a step outside the box and let them get to introduce themselves to this wonderful world through activity based education and many more interesting ways. We want to give all children a platform that which will give them the confidence to stand in this competitive world.<br><br>
                                            On 22nd May 2022, our team of volunteers visited the Girls hostel of Jeevan Samvardhan Foundation, Thane. They conducted crafting, drawing, dancing and played indoor games. All the activities have a motto to make a good bond with the girls to understand them.<br>

                                            Under Conserve to preserve, this was our third beach cleaning activity at Arnala Beach, Virar. As we decided that we will conduct the beach cleaning activity every month, this was the most successful activity. Because 20 volunteers participated and we cleaned a complete beach.<br><br>
                                            In this third beach cleaning activity, we actually focus on cleaning the beach with a team of 20 volunteers. As we created local awareness, it helped us quite well as we beach was getting less polluted with the wastages. Many people were using the dustbins or putting all the garbage near the food corners/ shop. We were very happy with the results.<br>

                                            Under Conserve to preserve, along with beach cleaning, tree plantation is the second initiative which we took this year. Planting new saplings is as important as conserving the old ones. On the occasion of World Environment Day, we decided that we will start this initiative with our partner Arnala Social Work Group.<br><br>
                                            In this Tree Plantation activity, we focus on planting the saplings near the beach area where we are conducting beach cleaning activities. Our motive was to plant a tree and let people know that this was not a place anymore to throw the wastages. Arnala Social Work Group supported the idea and together we implemented it. Other than that one of our volunteer planted some saplings in her residential area with the motive of creating awareness among the people.<br>

                                            Under our Unplugged Education project, we carry out many visits / activities to the hostels where we can interact with the children and help them wherever they need the help in studies or extra-curricular work. Unplugged Education is a very broad concept but we started with the basic steps. Under this, we try to take a step outside the box and let them get to introduce themselves to this wonderful world through activity based education and many more interesting ways. We want to give all children a platform which will give them confidence to stand in this competitive world. <br><br>
                                            On 11th June 2022, our team of volunteers visited the Girls hostel of Jeevan Samvardhan Foundation, Thane and अंकुर बालविकास केंद्र, टिटवाळा. They conducted crafting, drawing, dancing and played indoor games. All the activities have a motto to make a good bond with the girls to understand them.

                                            Under Conserve to preserve, this was our fourth beach cleaning activity at Arnala Beach, Virar. As we decided that we will conduct the beach cleaning activity every month, this was our first activity along with the Arnala Social Work Group.<br><br>
                                            In this beach cleaning activity, we actually focus on cleaning other parts of the beach with a team of Arnala Social Work Group. As we created local awareness, we got to know that there was an area where a lot of waste material was being accumulated due to monsoon rain. So with the help of our partner, we did a small beach cleaning activity and cleaned that part of the Beach. <br>

                                            On 12th June 2022, we conducted our second fort cleaning activity at the very famous Dronagiri Fort, Uran. We focused on the unknown area on the top of the fort, where we cleaned one side of the monument. Earlier it was not looking like a forest, but after cleaning we found out the top side of बुरुज. We were happy with the results. Thanks to all the volunteers who participated and made this possible.

                                            Under Conserve to preserve, along with beach cleaning, tree plantation is the second initiative which we took in this year. Planting new saplings is as important as conserving the old ones. We started this initiative on the occasion of World Environment day.<br><br>
                                            In this Tree Plantation activity, we focus on planting the saplings near the road area in VatarVillage, Palghar. Our motive is to plant saplings as much as possible. On a small scale, we did plant a few saplings. We make sure that water will be supplied on a regular basis.

                                            Under Conserve to preserve, this was our fifth beach cleaning activity at Arnala Beach, Virar. As we decided that we will conduct the beach cleaning activity every month, this was our first activity after the monsoon. As in monsoon season, we could not conduct any activity.<br><br>
                                            In this beach cleaning activity, we actually focus on cleaning other parts of the beach with a team of Arnala Social Work Group. As we created a local awareness, we got to know that there was an area where a lot of waste material was being accumulated due to monsoon rain. So with the help of our partner, we did a small beach cleaning activity and cleaned that part of the Beach.

We would like to Thank all the Soldiers on behalf of all Indians. We really appreciate the sacrifice they make for Our Motherland. The idea behind #rakhi_for_rakshak is to show our gratitude and tribute towards Your, Our Soldiers- Our Rakshak!<br><br>
                                            The moto behind this initiative is to make everyone aware about our real brothers who are protecting us in a real meaning. And to tell them that even if we are not there physically to tie a rakhi on their wrist we still stand beside them. We have sent 200 rakhis along with some messages we received from people. It's thanks giving tribute to our soldier brothers on behalf of many Indians.

                                            On the occasion of Independence Day, we visited 'Jeevan Samvardhan Foundation, Thane. We spent quality time with the girls over there, and we all had fun while celebrating activities. Last year we visited the Boys Hostel at Mhaskal on Independence Day.l We experienced that, they are very sharp in every aspect. Be it study or extra-curricular activities, they are rocking in every field. What they need is our support. And here we are to support every needy child. We believe you are with us, We need you to join us and be a part of their successful life.<br><br>

Our main motive is to make the children aware of the competitive world and counsel them whenever needed. We were continuously taking many activities / sessions with these girls and trying to guide them on the correct path.<br><br>
                                            On 28th August 2022, our team of volunteers visited Jeevan Samvardhan Foundation, Thane. We have conducted basic level counselling and study related activities. This activity was conducted for clearing doubts and making sure that they will follow their dream and passion.

                                            National Service Scheme (NSS) is a Central Sector Scheme of the Government of India. It provides an opportunity to the youth to take part in various government led community service activities & programmes. The sole aim of the NSS is to provide hands-on experience to young students in delivering community service. NSS is basically for college and senior students.<br><br>
                                            In this activity, we got approached by the NSS unit of SMT. INDIRA GANDHI COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, GHANSOLI. The leaders wanted to do something different from the regular activities, and we had an idea of showing them the real world of orphans and needy children. We organize an activity where NSS students and orphans can interact with each other and understand how they will be able to help them.<br><br>
                                            Activities were conducted in Jeevan Samvardhan Foundation, both girls and boys hostels.

                                            Under the helping hand, one of the important aspects is Health. As we have mentioned in our mission statement that we work on the basic needs of Human Beings. With the same motive, Toptime India Consumer Pvt Ltd Company organizes various health camps for the people. We organized a few camps before and the response was good.<br><br>
                                            In the Navratri Utsav, we have organized Ayurvedic Health Camp for all the people on 2nd October, 2022 in Rose garden, Mira Road. Around 75+ people have been checked up and consulted by the team. We have got responses till date for the Health Camps.

                                            "Diwali Ank" is another concept like the "Durg Dipostav". Swadhey Foundation always follows the uniqueness in every work they took in hand. Diwali Ank is the concept of a normal booklet which is given in schools or available in any book stores. These are basically named as Diwali Ank because it was meant to solve in Diwali vacation. It includes education related activities like drawing, general knowledge, information, and reading. It helps the children to be more competent and use their brains in solving such booklets.<br><br>
                                            In Swadhey Foundation's Diwali ank, we named it as "गरुडझेप", which means take a jump like Eagle and fly above all. As you know, An Eagle is a bird that flies really high in the sky and no one can fly above the eagle's height. So we had to name it like children who are solving the Diwali Ank of Swadhey Foundation, must try to take a jump (Try his best) to fly on Eagle's level or beyond that (To achieve the target which was set by you). In overall meaning, we wanted the children to get inspired from our Diwali Ank.<br><br>
                                            The whole design, content and preparation were done by the specially qualified teachers in schools. This year we made two separate Diwali Ank based on our last years experience. One for junior students and another for above 3rd standards till 8th. For students above 8th standard, we made a list of tasks or activities which helped them to build a very strong base for further education. This year we distributed it to our Jeevan Samvardhan Foundation and many people took it from us for their children.

                                            "Durg Dipotsav" is one of the best concepts we have in our Fort Conservation Objective. The idea is to celebrate Diwali on the forts in very unique ways. We  implemented this idea first in 2020, when we took a very small step for the conservation of the fort which was successful.<br><br>
                                            As you know, during Durg Dipotsav, fort cleaning campaigns, fort decoration, and lighting of lamps were done by Swadhey. This year we went to Pimplas fort located in Bhiwandi. The fort itself has historical importance and we tried to bring a little happiness among the volunteers and implemented our conservation thoughts. Every year our volunteers or participants increased and many other foundations / institutes started celebrating with us, which is itself an achievement. This year too, we cleaned the fort's surroundings, decorated it with flowers and lightened the lamps.<br><br>
                                            A wholehearted thank you to everyone who participated in this campaign and supported us.

In this activity, we had low participants but our 5-6 volunteers are enough to conduct an activity too.<br><br>
                                            In this beach cleaning activity, we actually focus on cleaning one single part of the beach due to limited team members. Also, there were local people working on the beach side so we could not clean the whole beach. But we did as much as possible. As we created a local awareness, the people said that once their work is done they will collect the waste and put it in dustbins.<br>

                                            In our second endeavour of the year, Swadhey Foundation embarked on a 20-day Kind Donation Drive Campaign, an initiative fuelled by the spirit of generosity and compassion. The response was overwhelming as we collected clothes, notebooks, books, shoes, bags, and other essentials from our community.<br><br>
                                            Highlights: <br>
                                            Community Generosity: Our campaign received an incredible response from people eager to contribute to the well-being of others. <br>
                                            Material Collection: Over the course of 20 days, we collected a diverse range of items that would make a significant impact on the lives of those in need. <br>
                                            Satkarma Balakashram Activity: A culmination of our efforts took place at Satkarma Balakashram in Badlapur. Here, we organized a small yet impactful activity, distributing the donated materials to the little ones at the shelter. <br>
                                            Positive Impact: Witnessing the joy and gratitude on the faces of the recipients affirmed the positive impact our collective efforts can have on the community.<br><br>
                                            This campaign is a testament to the power of collective kindness. It not only provided essential items to those who needed them but also fostered a sense of community and shared responsibility. As we continue our mission, we invite you to join us. Whether through donations, volunteering, or spreading the word, your support contributes to creating positive change in the lives of those less fortunate. Thank you to everyone who participated in the Kind Donation Drive. Your generosity has made a meaningful difference in our community.

When we met them, they also wanted to conduct camps with the help of Swadhyay foundation, and then we needed to set a date for the camp and decided that let’s start the year with an Ayurvedic Health Camp.
